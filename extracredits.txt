Programming Assignment 3 Web Crawler

Graphical dashboard (shows stats over time)

To implement the graphical dashboard, I stored the CPU and memory
information in another table. Every time the ajax call is made to 
the web role, the web role will return a last 100 data sets.
In the js file, I used D3 to draw out the data. The graph is updated
every 1 second.

Crawl more root domains

I was able to crawl IMDB, BBC, Forbes, ESPN, and Wikipedia. I 
used a packet called RobotsTxt and stored the robot in a dictionary 
with the key as domain URI and value as the robot. Therefore,
when the website being crawler's base is in the dictionary, the
robot would be used to check the link for allowing and disallow.
